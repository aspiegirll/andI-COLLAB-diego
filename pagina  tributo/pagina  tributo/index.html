            <li > <strong>1914</strong> Born in Cresco  Iowa </li>
            <li> <strong>1935</strong> Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
            how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
            <li> <strong>1942</strong> Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
       </li>
       <li> <strong>1962</strong> Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass
    starvation due to a rapidly expanding population </li>
        <li> <strong>1984</strong>becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>
        <li> <strong>2005</strong> states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
        been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
        the best breeds." </li>
        <li> <strong>2009</strong> dies at the age of 95.  </li>
